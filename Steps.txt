1ï¼‰Input projetion matrix and vector matrix
  - What is the bitwidth of vector matrix, why is the projection matrix can be arranged like figure 7

2) accumilate partial sum of d(H)
  - What is the bitdwidth of d
  - Should the adder be pipelined
3) After H is done, what is next?

- 8 bit for weight
- slide horiztonally
- Need to feed the adder with right data  - memeory controller
- pipelined the adder
